# Roll A Ball

A university lab mini-project where I make a basic physics game where you pick up all the diagonal cubes to win.

### Features:
- For every picked up cube the score increments
- A WebGL link to play the game on web browser
- WASD or arrow keys work when moving the ball around 
  - Uses physics to move
- You win when you collect all four cubes!
